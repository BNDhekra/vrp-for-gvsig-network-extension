This is the supporting site of the extVRP extension.

extVRP is an extension to [gvSIG](http://www.gvsig.org/web/) that solves the Vehicle Routing Problem.

The Vehicle Routing Problem can be defined as:

_Given a set of vehicles and a set of customers that need to be served by those vehicles, find the set of routes with the global minimum cost in which the vehicles serve every customer._

This is a very importante problem in real life, with plenty of applications.


You can start by going to the [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/vrp-for-gvsig-network-extension/downloads/list) section and getting all the files.
Read the [guide](http://vrp-for-gvsig-network-extension.googlecode.com/files/extVRP_Documentation.pdf) and use the [sample data](http://vrp-for-gvsig-network-extension.googlecode.com/files/Sample_Data.zip).

There's a [javadoc](https://vrp-for-gvsig-network-extension.googlecode.com/svn-history/r26/trunk/extVRP/documentation/javadoc/index.html) too.

Good luck and happy routing!
